## Software Developer in Training

### Positive Change Through Honest & Hard Work

Retail expert with 14+ years of experience, with a background in inventory management, team leadership & customer service. A reliable leader that loves to see growth with the ability to adapt in difficult situations. Entertainer with a background in life broadcasting. Both industries have taught me much about critical thinking, rolling with the punches, problem solving, and to never stop trying to gain more knowledge! You never can know everything, even after a decade+ in the same industry! I built my first PC in 2012 and have built 10+ for friends and family. Tech lover who finally is making the jump into the field & learning everything that fits into my brain.

I'm most excited about the endless possibilities of technology. I love the idea of making something that either makes something possible that wasn't previously, or making doing something in life easier for the future generations!
